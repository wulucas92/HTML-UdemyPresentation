                    <p>Hello, I'm Lucas Wu, a mobile phone programmer and website engineer. I have worked in the IT Department of the Bank of England (HSBC) for six years. I hope to set up some courses to help anyone who has no experience in program development learn IT-related languages and tools more easily.</p>

                    <p> And I hope to make some more complete courses with many practical examples to help students understand the knowledge of the whole subject comprehensively in a short time, at the same time, let the new knowledge be applied to the actual operation and work.</p>
            
                    <p>On the Udemy platform, my course has become one of the best-selling Chinese courses. I hope to create more courses that everyone agrees with, more courses with detailed content and rich examples, and I look forward to seeing you in the course! And thanks to all the students who supported me!</p>
